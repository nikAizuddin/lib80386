A library that contains a collections of various function that are
written in x86 NASM Assembler. However, the functions are tested on
Linux only, and not yet tested on Windows/Mac.

## HOW TO USE lib80386?
    STEP 1: You need a NASM Assembler.

    STEP 2: In this folder lib80386, PLEASE read the reference
            manual in the folder doc/reference_manual.

            The reference manual explains how to use the function.

            But just reading the manual is not enough, you also need
            to see the example how to use it. I have already include
            a simple getting_started example for each functions.

    Goodluck !! :D
