This will test the append_string, make sure no errors.

We will test the function by using these values:
================================================

test 0001:
    t0001_s01_beg = "For humans, written communication is crucial.
                     Unfortunately, computers were not specifically
                     designed for ease of communication with humans.
                     Most high-level languages provide specific
                     functions for helping programmers write programs
                     to interact with humans."
    t0001_s02_beg = "As an assembly language programmer, you do not
                     have the luxury of these functions. It is up to
                     you to code your programs to interact with humans
                     in their own language."
    t0001_s03_beg = "The use of strings helps programs communicate
                     with humans in their own langauge. While using
                     strings is not a simple matter in assembly
                     language programming, it is not impossible."
    t0001_s04_beg = "~Professional Assembly Language, by Richard
                      Blum. Page 273"
    t0001_outstr should have all the those s01 until s04.
